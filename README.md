# RWE & Data Science Analytics Portfolio

Hello, my name is Li Yi, and I am a PhD-level RWE scientist specializing in applying advanced methods to solve complex health research problems.

This portfolio showcases a selection of my work, demonstrating my capabilities in end-to-end study execution, advanced causal inference, building scalable data pipelines, and my conceptual mastery of RWE (claims, cohorts) data analysis.

### Portfolio Contents

Each folder contains a project with a dedicated `README.md` explaining the business problem, the technical solution, and its relevance to RWE.

*   **[1. SAS: End-to-End RWE Study](./1_SAS_End_to_End_RWE_Study/)**
    *   **Skill Demonstrated:** A complete, publication-quality survival analysis in SAS on a large-scale cohort, proving my ability to lead a study from data preparation to final modeling.

*   **[2. R: Causal Inference with IPW](./2_R_Causal_Inference_with_IPW/)**
    *   **Skill Demonstrated:** A robust implementation of a Marginal Structural Model using Inverse Probability Weighting, showcasing deep methodological expertise in causal inference for longitudinal data.

*   **[3. Python: Scalable Data Pipeline](./3_Python_Scalable_Data_Pipeline/)**
    *   **Skill Demonstrated:** A production-minded Python script for batch-processing unstructured image data. This proves my ability to think like a systems builder and create efficient, automated solutions.

*   **[4. RWE Case Study: Claims Data](./4_RWE_Case_Study_Claims_Data/)**
    *   **Skill Demonstrated:** A detailed methodological write-up of a claims-based study. This document showcases my practical, hands-on understanding of the unique challenges of working with payer data, from cohort construction with ICD/NDC codes to endpoint definition.
